Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to retain valuable customers and improve profitability. This project demonstrates a complete workflow for predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and evaluation of predictive performance. It is designed for both beginners and intermediate machine learning enthusiasts.

Objectives

Understand the factors influencing customer churn.

Preprocess and clean real-world customer data.

Perform feature selection to identify important predictors.

Build and train machine learning models for churn prediction.

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.

Gain hands-on experience in solving a real-world business problem.

Dataset

The dataset contains customer-related information, including demographic details, account details, usage patterns, and customer service interactions.

It typically includes features such as:

Customer ID

Gender, Age, Geography

Account balance and tenure

Product usage metrics

Customer service interactions

Churn status (target variable)

Project Workflow

Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Load and inspect the dataset.

Handle missing values and incorrect data types.

Encode categorical variables.

Normalize or scale numerical features if needed.

Feature Selection

Identify the most relevant features that contribute to churn.

Use correlation analysis and feature importance techniques.

Model Building

Split data into training and testing sets.

Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
